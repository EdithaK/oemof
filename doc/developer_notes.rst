 Developer Notes
=========================================

Here we gather important notes for the developing of oemof and elements within
the framework.


Collaboration
-----------------------------------------

We use the collaboration features from Github, see https://github.com/oemof.


Git branching model
-----------------------------------------

So far we adhere mostly to the git branching model by Vincent Driessen, see
http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/.

The only difference is to use a different name for the branch origin/develop 
("main branch where the source code of HEAD always reflects a state with the 
latest delivered development changes for the next release. Some would call this 
the integration branch."). The name we use is origin/dev.


Issue-Management
-----------------------------------------

Section about workflow for issues is still missing (when to assign an issue with
what kind of tracker to whom etc.).
